This is a private repo for task 1 of eveIT

I have created a API using express to do this task.

First i have created a function to find closest number / numbers to our
target number, which has been created in utils folder under findNum.js
there we exported that in Modules

Then we create a express server in our app.js create one API and fetches the data using POST request.
Make our computaions and return the result to the API.

Necesssary status codes has also been used, and errors are also handled.
